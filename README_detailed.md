## Initialization

- Set up logging
- Initialize OpenAI client (using a local LLM server)
- Define MoleculeDatabase class for DeepLake vector database interactions

## Description Generation Process

The `generate_technical_descriptions` function is the core of this phase, using a language model to generate and refine protein-ligand pair descriptions.

### Initial Description Generation

1. Prompt language model to create initial protein and ligand descriptions based on user input
2. Expect output in specific JSON format

### Database Query

1. Use generated protein description to query molecule database
2. Retrieve relevant molecules based on the description

### Iterative Refinement

1. Enter reflection and refinement loop
2. Prompt language model to consider quality, novelty, and feasibility
3. Refine descriptions, incorporating retrieved molecule information
4. Repeat for specified number of reflections or until completion

### Storage and Yield

1. Save descriptions to JSON file after each successful generation
2. Yield generated descriptions for real-time processing

### Error Handling

- Implement error handling for potential issues during description generation

## Main Execution (run_Phase_1)

1. Set up directories and initialize molecule database
2. Call `generate_technical_descriptions` and process results
3. Generate multiple description sets based on `max_generations` parameter

## Summary

Phase 1 generates and refines technical descriptions for protein-ligand pairs, using:

- Language model for creative generation
- Molecule database for grounding in existing knowledge
- Iterative process to improve quality and feasibility

# Phase 2

## Phase 2a: Protein Generation and Optimization

### Initial Protein Generation

- Uses the ProGen2 model to generate initial protein sequences based on the input text
- Removes invalid characters from the generated sequence

### Sequence-based Optimization

- Employs multiple mutation strategies: basic mutation, BERT-guided mutation, and advanced mutation
- Uses a SimpleMutationPredictor and ProtBERTAnalyzer for sequence analysis
- Implements adaptive mutation rates based on iteration progress and current scores
- Generates multiple candidate sequences, including crossover sequences
- Evaluates candidates using a protein function prediction method

### Structure Generation and Validation

- Uses the ESM3 model to generate 3D structures for the best sequences
- Validates the initial structure against the input requirements

### Further Optimization

- If validation passes, performs functional testing and stability optimization
- Applies protein engineering techniques to further refine the structure

### Iterative Process

- Repeats the optimization process for a specified number of cycles
- Keeps track of the best sequence and score throughout the process

## Phase 2b: Ligand Generation and Optimization

### SMILES Generation

- Uses a T5-based model to generate initial SMILES strings based on the technical instruction

### SMILES Optimization

- Employs genetic algorithm techniques to optimize the SMILES strings
- Uses a fitness function that considers LogP and QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness)
- Implements mutation and crossover operations specific to SMILES strings

### 3D Structure Prediction

- Converts optimized SMILES to 3D structures using RDKit
- Performs energy minimization to find the most stable conformer

### Ensemble Docking

- Docks the generated ligand against an ensemble of protein structures
- Uses AutoDock Vina for docking simulations
- Determines binding site dynamically or uses a predefined binding site

### Docking Analysis

- Performs molecular dynamics simulations on the docked complexes
- Analyzes trajectories to calculate RMSD and RMSF values

### Ligand Scoring and Selection

- Combines docking affinity scores and MD simulation results to score ligands
- Selects the best ligand based on the combined score

Both phases work in parallel, with the protein sequences generated in Phase 2a being used as targets for the ligands generated in Phase 2b. The results from both phases are then passed on to Phase 3 for final analysis and reporting.
