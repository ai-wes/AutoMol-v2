    "technical_description_protein": "Generate a protein designed to selectively activate telomerase in stem cells while minimizing activation in somatic cells. The protein should have specific amino acid sequences that allow it to bind to and potentially activate telomerase, which is essential for the maintenance of cellular life but can contribute to cancer risk if unchecked. The protein structure should be stable and capable of maintaining its activity without causing significant harm or toxicity to normal cells.",
    "technical_description_ligand": "Design a small molecule that selectively binds to the generated telomerase-activating protein, effectively activating telomerase in stem cells. The ligand should have specific chemical properties that allow it to recognize and interact with the protein's binding sites while minimizing interaction with normal somatic cell proteins. The molecule should be designed to avoid potential harmful interactions that could lead to cancer or excessive stimulation of cellular replication without specifically targeting stem cells."
