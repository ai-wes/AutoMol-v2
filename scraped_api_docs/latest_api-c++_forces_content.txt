ForcesÂ¶ The Force abstract classÂ¶ The Force objects added to a System define the behavior of the particles. Force is an abstract class; subclasses implement specific behaviors. Classes that extend Force may implement actual physical forces, or any number of processes that either actually apply forces to particles or directly modify their positions or momenta. Force Common bonded and non-bonded forcesÂ¶ These classes implement forces that are widely used in biomolecular simulation.

They are used to implement thermostats or barostats, or otherwise modify the simulation from step to step. They are conceptually closer to modifications to the integrator, but providing them as a Force simplifies implementation and allows them to be combined in arbitrary ways.

These classes implement constructors that take an algebraic expression as a string. The class is instantiated (not extended) to provide a Force object that efficiently implements the provided expression.
