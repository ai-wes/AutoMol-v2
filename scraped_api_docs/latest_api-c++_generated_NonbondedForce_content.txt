NonbondedForceÂ¶ class NonbondedForce : public OpenMM::ForceÂ¶ This class implements nonbonded interactions between particles, including a Coulomb force to represent electrostatics and a Lennard-Jones force to represent van der Waals interactions. It optionally supports periodic boundary conditions and cutoffs for long range interactions. Lennard-Jones interactions are calculated with the Lorentz-Berthelot combining rule: it uses the arithmetic mean of the sigmas and the geometric mean of the epsilons for the two interacting particles. To use this class, create a NonbondedForce object, then call addParticle() once for each particle in the System to define its parameters. The number of particles for which you define nonbonded parameters must be exactly equal to the number of particles in the System, or else an exception will be thrown when you try to create a Context. After a particle has been added, you can modify its force field parameters by calling setParticleParameters(). This will have no effect on Contexts that already exist unless you call updateParametersInContext(). NonbondedForce also lets you specify âexceptionsâ, particular pairs of particles whose interactions should be computed based on different parameters than those defined for the individual particles. This can be used to completely exclude certain interactions from the force calculation, or to alter how they interact with each other. Many molecular force fields omit Coulomb and Lennard-Jones interactions between particles separated by one or two bonds, while using modified parameters for those separated by three bonds (known as â1-4 interactionsâ). This class provides a convenience method for this case called createExceptionsFromBonds(). You pass to it a list of bonds and the scale factors to use for 1-4 interactions. It identifies all pairs of particles which are separated by 1, 2, or 3 bonds, then automatically creates exceptions for them. When using a cutoff, by default Lennard-Jones interactions are sharply truncated at the cutoff distance. Optionally you can instead use a switching function to make the interaction smoothly go to zero over a finite distance range. To enable this, call setUseSwitchingFunction(). You must also call setSwitchingDistance() to specify the distance at which the interaction should begin to decrease. The switching distance must be less than the cutoff distance. Another optional feature of this class (enabled by default) is to add a contribution to the energy which approximates the effect of all Lennard-Jones interactions beyond the cutoff in a periodic system. When running a simulation at constant pressure, this can improve the quality of the result. Call setUseDispersionCorrection() to set whether this should be used. In some applications, it is useful to be able to inexpensively change the parameters of small groups of particles. Usually this is done to interpolate between two sets of parameters. For example, a titratable group might have two states it can exist in, each described by a different set of parameters for the atoms that make up the group. You might then want to smoothly interpolate between the two states. This is done by first calling addGlobalParameter() to define a Context parameter, then addParticleParameterOffset() to create a âparameter offsetâ that depends on the Context parameter. Each offset defines the following: A Context parameter used to interpolate between the states. A single particle whose parameters are influenced by the Context parameter. Three scale factors (chargeScale, sigmaScale, and epsilonScale) that specify how the Context parameter affects the particle. The âeffectiveâ parameters for a particle (those used to compute forces) are given by charge = baseCharge + param*chargeScale sigma = baseSigma + param*sigmaScale epsilon = baseEpsilon + param*epsilonScale where the âbaseâ values are the ones specified by addParticle() and âoaramâ is the current value of the Context parameter. A single Context parameter can apply offsets to multiple particles, and multiple parameters can be used to apply offsets to the same particle. Parameters can also be used to modify exceptions in exactly the same way by calling addExceptionParameterOffset(). Public Types enum NonbondedMethodÂ¶ This is an enumeration of the different methods that may be used for handling long range nonbonded forces. Values: enumerator NoCutoffÂ¶ No cutoff is applied to nonbonded interactions. The full set of N^2 interactions is computed exactly. This necessarily means that periodic boundary conditions cannot be used. This is the default. enumerator CutoffNonPeriodicÂ¶ Interactions beyond the cutoff distance are ignored. Coulomb interactions closer than the cutoff distance are modified using the reaction field method. enumerator CutoffPeriodicÂ¶ Periodic boundary conditions are used, so that each particle interacts only with the nearest periodic copy of each other particle. Interactions beyond the cutoff distance are ignored. Coulomb interactions closer than the cutoff distance are modified using the reaction field method. enumerator EwaldÂ¶ Periodic boundary conditions are used, and Ewald summation is used to compute the Coulomb interaction of each particle with all periodic copies of every other particle. enumerator PMEÂ¶ Periodic boundary conditions are used, and Particle-Mesh Ewald (PME) summation is used to compute the Coulomb interaction of each particle with all periodic copies of every other particle. enumerator LJPMEÂ¶ Periodic boundary conditions are used, and Particle-Mesh Ewald (PME) summation is used to compute the interaction of each particle with all periodic copies of every other particle for both Coulomb and Lennard-Jones. No switching is used for either interaction.

This should be called once for each particle in the System. When it is called for the iâth time, it specifies the parameters for the iâth particle. For calculating the Lennard-Jones interaction between two particles, the arithmetic mean of the sigmas and the geometric mean of the epsilons for the two interacting particles is used (the Lorentz-Berthelot combining rule). Parameters charge â the charge of the particle, measured in units of the proton charge sigma â the sigma parameter of the Lennard-Jones potential (corresponding to the van der Waals radius of the particle), measured in nm epsilon â the epsilon parameter of the Lennard-Jones potential (corresponding to the well depth of the van der Waals interaction), measured in kJ/mol Returns the index of the particle that was added void getParticleParameters(int index, double &charge, double &sigma, double &epsilon) constÂ¶ Get the nonbonded force parameters for a particle.

When calculating the Lennard-Jones interaction between two particles, it uses the arithmetic mean of the sigmas and the geometric mean of the epsilons for the two interacting particles (the Lorentz-Berthelot combining rule). Parameters index â the index of the particle for which to set parameters charge â the charge of the particle, measured in units of the proton charge sigma â the sigma parameter of the Lennard-Jones potential (corresponding to the van der Waals radius of the particle), measured in nm epsilon â the epsilon parameter of the Lennard-Jones potential (corresponding to the well depth of the van der Waals interaction), measured in kJ/mol int addException(int particle1, int particle2, double chargeProd, double sigma, double epsilon, bool replace = false)Â¶ Add an interaction to the list of exceptions that should be calculated differently from other interactions. If chargeProd and epsilon are both equal to 0, this will cause the interaction to be completely omitted from force and energy calculations. Regardless of the NonbondedMethod used by this Force, cutoffs are never applied to exceptions. That is because they are primarily used for 1-4 interactions, which are really a type of bonded interaction and are parametrized together with the other bonded interactions. In many cases, you can use createExceptionsFromBonds() rather than adding each exception explicitly. Parameters particle1 â the index of the first particle involved in the interaction particle2 â the index of the second particle involved in the interaction chargeProd â the scaled product of the atomic charges (i.e. the strength of the Coulomb interaction), measured in units of the proton charge squared sigma â the sigma parameter of the Lennard-Jones potential (corresponding to the van der Waals radius of the particle), measured in nm epsilon â the epsilon parameter of the Lennard-Jones potential (corresponding to the well depth of the van der Waals interaction), measured in kJ/mol replace â determines the behavior if there is already an exception for the same two particles.

If chargeProd and epsilon are both equal to 0, this will cause the interaction to be completely omitted from force and energy calculations. Regardless of the NonbondedMethod used by this Force, cutoffs are never applied to exceptions. That is because they are primarily used for 1-4 interactions, which are really a type of bonded interaction and are parametrized together with the other bonded interactions.

Particles which are separated by one or two bonds are set to not interact at all, while pairs of particles separated by three bonds (known as â1-4 interactionsâ) have their Coulomb and Lennard-Jones interactions reduced by a fixed factor. Parameters bonds â the set of bonds based on which to construct exceptions. Each element specifies the indices of two particles that are bonded to each other. coulomb14Scale â pairs of particles separated by three bonds will have the strength of their Coulomb interaction multiplied by this factor lj14Scale â pairs of particles separated by three bonds will have the strength of their Lennard-Jones interaction multiplied by this factor int addGlobalParameter(const std::string &name, double defaultValue)Â¶ Add a new global parameter that parameter offsets may depend on. The default value provided to this method is the initial value of the parameter in newly created Contexts. You can change the value at any time by calling setParameter() on the Context.

Parameters index â the index of the offset to query, as returned by addExceptionParameterOffset() parameter â the name of the global parameter exceptionIndex â the index of the exception whose parameters are affected chargeProdScale â this value multiplied by the parameter value is added to the exceptionâs charge product sigmaScale â this value multiplied by the parameter value is added to the exceptionâs sigma epsilonScale â this value multiplied by the parameter value is added to the exceptionâs epsilon void setExceptionParameterOffset(int index, const std::string &parameter, int exceptionIndex, double chargeProdScale, double sigmaScale, double epsilonScale)Â¶ Set the offset added to the parameters of a particular exception, based on a global parameter. Parameters index â the index of the offset to modify, as returned by addExceptionParameterOffset() parameter â the name of the global parameter. It must have already been added with addGlobalParameter(). Its value can be modified at any time by calling Context::setParameter(). exceptionIndex â the index of the exception whose parameters are affected chargeProdScale â this value multiplied by the parameter value is added to the exceptionâs charge product sigmaScale â this value multiplied by the parameter value is added to the exceptionâs sigma epsilonScale â this value multiplied by the parameter value is added to the exceptionâs epsilon inline bool getUseDispersionCorrection() constÂ¶ Get whether to add a contribution to the energy that approximately represents the effect of Lennard-Jones interactions beyond the cutoff distance. The energy depends on the volume of the periodic box, and is only applicable when periodic boundary conditions are used. When running simulations at constant pressure, adding this contribution can improve the quality of results. inline void setUseDispersionCorrection(bool useCorrection)Â¶ Set whether to add a contribution to the energy that approximately represents the effect of Lennard-Jones interactions beyond the cutoff distance. The energy depends on the volume of the periodic box, and is only applicable when periodic boundary conditions are used. When running simulations at constant pressure, adding this contribution can improve the quality of results. int getReciprocalSpaceForceGroup() constÂ¶ Get the force group that reciprocal space interactions for Ewald or PME are included in. This allows multiple time step integrators to evaluate direct and reciprocal space interactions at different intervals: getForceGroup() specifies the group for direct space, and getReciprocalSpaceForceGroup() specifies the group for reciprocal space. If this is -1 (the default value), the same force group is used for reciprocal space as for direct space. void setReciprocalSpaceForceGroup(int group)Â¶ Set the force group that reciprocal space interactions for Ewald or PME are included in. This allows multiple time step integrators to evaluate direct and reciprocal space interactions at different intervals: setForceGroup() specifies the group for direct space, and setReciprocalSpaceForceGroup() specifies the group for reciprocal space. If this is -1 (the default value), the same force group is used for reciprocal space as for direct space. Parameters group â the group index. Legal values are between 0 and 31 (inclusive), or -1 to use the same force group that is specified for direct space. bool getIncludeDirectSpace() constÂ¶ Get whether to include direct space interactions when calculating forces and energies. This is useful if you want to completely replace the direct space calculation, typically with a CustomNonbondedForce that computes it in a nonstandard way, while still using this object for the reciprocal space calculation. void setIncludeDirectSpace(bool include)Â¶ Set whether to include direct space interactions when calculating forces and energies. This is useful if you want to completely replace the direct space calculation, typically with a CustomNonbondedForce that computes it in a nonstandard way, while still using this object for the reciprocal space calculation. void updateParametersInContext(Context &context)Â¶ Update the particle and exception parameters in a Context to match those stored in this Force object. This method provides an efficient method to update certain parameters in an existing Context without needing to reinitialize it. Simply call setParticleParameters() and setExceptionParameters() to modify this objectâs parameters, then call updateParametersInContext() to copy them over to the Context. This method has several limitations. The only information it updates is the parameters of particles and exceptions. All other aspects of the Force (the nonbonded method, the cutoff distance, etc.) are unaffected and can only be changed by reinitializing the Context. Furthermore, only the chargeProd, sigma, and epsilon values of an exception can be changed; the pair of particles involved in the exception cannot change. Finally, this method cannot be used to add new particles or exceptions, only to change the parameters of existing ones. inline virtual bool usesPeriodicBoundaryConditions() constÂ¶ Returns whether or not this force makes use of periodic boundary conditions. Returns true if force uses PBC and false otherwise bool getExceptionsUsePeriodicBoundaryConditions() constÂ¶ Get whether periodic boundary conditions should be applied to exceptions. Usually this is not appropriate, because exceptions are normally used to represent bonded interactions (1-2, 1-3, and 1-4 pairs), but there are situations when it does make sense. For example, you may want to simulate an infinite chain where one end of a molecule is bonded to the opposite end of the next periodic copy. Regardless of this value, periodic boundary conditions are only applied to exceptions if they also are applied to other interactions. If the nonbonded method is NoCutoff or CutoffNonPeriodic, this value is ignored. Also note that cutoffs are never applied to exceptions, again because they are normally used to represent bonded interactions. void setExceptionsUsePeriodicBoundaryConditions(bool periodic)Â¶ Set whether periodic boundary conditions should be applied to exceptions. Usually this is not appropriate, because exceptions are normally used to represent bonded interactions (1-2, 1-3, and 1-4 pairs), but there are situations when it does make sense. For example, you may want to simulate an infinite chain where one end of a molecule is bonded to the opposite end of the next periodic copy. Regardless of this value, periodic boundary conditions are only applied to exceptions if they also get applied to other interactions. If the nonbonded method is NoCutoff or CutoffNonPeriodic, this value is ignored. Also note that cutoffs are never applied to exceptions, again because they are normally used to represent bonded interactions.
