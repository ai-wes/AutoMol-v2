VerletIntegratorÂ¶ class VerletIntegrator : public OpenMM::IntegratorÂ¶ This is an Integrator which simulates a System using the leap-frog Verlet algorithm. Public Functions explicit VerletIntegrator(double stepSize)Â¶ Create a VerletIntegrator. Parameters stepSize â the step size with which to integrate the system (in picoseconds) virtual void step(int steps)Â¶ Advance a simulation through time by taking a series of time steps. Parameters steps â the number of time steps to take
