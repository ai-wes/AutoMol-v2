IntegratorsÂ¶ The Integrator abstract classÂ¶ An Integrator implements an algorithm for advancing the simulation through time. Integrator is an abstract class; subclasses implement specific algorithms. Integrator General purpose integratorsÂ¶ These are integrators appropriate for traditional MD and BD simulations.

RPMDIntegrator Customizing IntegratorÂ¶ These classes facilitate customisation of the integrator. CustomIntegrator allows a wide variety of integration algorithms to be implemented efficiently without writing any low-level code. The integrator is built up as a series of steps, each defined as an algebraic expression. CompoundIntegrator allows different integrators to be combined by making it possible to switch the active integrator in the middle of a simulation. CustomIntegrator CompoundIntegrator
