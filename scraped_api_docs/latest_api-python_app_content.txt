CharmmRstFile(fname) Reads and parses data, velocities and coordinates from a CHARMM restart file (.rst) of file name âfnameâ into class attributes DCDFile(file,Â topology,Â dt[,Â firstStep,Â â¦]) DCDFile provides methods for creating DCD files. DesmondDMSFile(file[,Â verbose]) DesmondDMSFile parses a Desmond DMS (desmond molecular system) and constructs a topology and (optionally) an OpenMM System from it GromacsGroFile(file) GromacsGroFile parses a Gromacs .gro file and constructs a set of atom positions from it. GromacsTopFile(file[,Â periodicBoxVectors,Â â¦]) GromacsTopFile parses a Gromacs top file and constructs a Topology and (optionally) an OpenMM System from it. PDBFile(file[,Â extraParticleIdentifier]) PDBFile parses a Protein Data Bank (PDB) file and constructs a Topology and a set of atom positions from it. PDBxFile(file) PDBxFile parses a PDBx/mmCIF file and constructs a Topology and a set of atom positions from it. XTCFile(fileName,Â topology,Â dt[,Â firstStep,Â â¦]) XTCFile provides methods for creating XTC files. Representation and ManipulationÂ¶ Topology() Topology stores the topological information about a system. Chain(index,Â topology,Â id) A Chain object represents a chain within a Topology. Residue(name,Â index,Â chain,Â id,Â insertionCode) A Residue object represents a residue within a Topology. Atom(name,Â element,Â index,Â residue,Â id) An Atom object represents an atom within a Topology. Modeller(topology,Â positions) Modeller provides tools for editing molecular models, such as adding water or missing hydrogens. SimulationÂ¶ ForceField(*files) A ForceField constructs OpenMM System objects based on a Topology. Simulation(topology,Â system,Â integrator[,Â â¦]) Simulation provides a simplified API for running simulations with OpenMM and reporting results. Reporting OutputÂ¶ CheckpointReporter(file,Â reportInterval[,Â â¦]) CheckpointReporter saves periodic checkpoints of a simulation. DCDReporter(file,Â reportInterval[,Â append,Â â¦]) DCDReporter outputs a series of frames from a Simulation to a DCD file. PDBReporter(file,Â reportInterval[,Â â¦]) PDBReporter outputs a series of frames from a Simulation to a PDB file. PDBxReporter(file,Â reportInterval[,Â â¦]) PDBxReporter outputs a series of frames from a Simulation to a PDBx/mmCIF file. StateDataReporter(file,Â reportInterval[,Â â¦]) StateDataReporter outputs information about a simulation, such as energy and temperature, to a file. XTCReporter(file,Â reportInterval[,Â append,Â â¦]) XTCReporter outputs a series of frames from a Simulation to a XTC file. ExtrasÂ¶ BiasVariable(force,Â minValue,Â maxValue,Â â¦) A collective variable that can be used to bias a simulation with metadynamics. CharmmPSFWarning For non-fatal PSF parsing issues Element(number,Â name,Â symbol,Â mass) An Element represents a chemical element. Metadynamics(system,Â variables,Â temperature,Â â¦) Performs metadynamics. SimulatedTempering(simulation[,Â â¦]) SimulatedTempering implements the simulated tempering algorithm for accelerated sampling. UnitsÂ¶ BaseDimension A physical dimension such as length, mass, or temperature. BaseUnit Physical unit expressed in exactly one BaseDimension. Quantity Physical quantity, such as 1.3 meters per second. ScaledUnit ScaledUnit is like a BaseUnit, but it is based on another Unit. SiPrefix Unit prefix that can be multiplied by a unit to yield a new unit. Unit Physical unit such as meter or ampere. UnitSystem A complete system of units defining the base unit in each dimension
