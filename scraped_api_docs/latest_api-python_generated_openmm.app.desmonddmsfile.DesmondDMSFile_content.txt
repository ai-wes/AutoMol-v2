DesmondDMSFileÂ¶ class openmm.app.desmonddmsfile.DesmondDMSFile(file, verbose=False)Â¶ DesmondDMSFile parses a Desmond DMS (desmond molecular system) and constructs a topology and (optionally) an OpenMM System from it __init__(file, verbose=False)Â¶ Load a DMS file Parameters file (list of strings (multiple files, each containing a molecule)) â or â file â name(s) of the file to load (the) â Methods __init__(file[,Â verbose]) Load a DMS file close() Close the SQL connections createSystem([nonbondedMethod,Â â¦]) Construct an OpenMM System representing the topology described by this DMS file getPositions() Get the positions of each atom in the system getProvenance() Get the provenance string of this system getTopology() Get the topology of the system getVelocities() Get the positions of each atom in the system setPositions(positions) Update atomic positions in attached DMS files setVelocities(velocities) Update atomic velocities in attached DMS files getPositions()Â¶ Get the positions of each atom in the system getVelocities()Â¶ Get the positions of each atom in the system getTopology()Â¶ Get the topology of the system getProvenance()Â¶ Get the provenance string of this system setPositions(positions)Â¶ Update atomic positions in attached DMS files setVelocities(velocities)Â¶ Update atomic velocities in attached DMS files createSystem(nonbondedMethod=NoCutoff, nonbondedCutoff=Quantity(value=1.0, unit=nanometer), ewaldErrorTolerance=0.0005, removeCMMotion=True, hydrogenMass=None, OPLS=False, implicitSolvent=None, AGBNPVersion=1)Â¶ Construct an OpenMM System representing the topology described by this DMS file Parameters nonbondedMethod (object=NoCutoff) â The method to use for nonbonded interactions. Allowed values are NoCutoff, CutoffNonPeriodic, CutoffPeriodic, Ewald, PME, or LJPME. nonbondedCutoff (distance=1*nanometer) â The cutoff distance to use for nonbonded interactions ewaldErrorTolerance (float=0.0005) â The error tolerance to use if nonbondedMethod is Ewald, PME, or LJPME. removeCMMotion (boolean=True) â If true, a CMMotionRemover will be added to the System hydrogenMass (mass=None) â The mass to use for hydrogen atoms bound to heavy atoms. Any mass added to a hydrogen is subtracted from the heavy atom to keep their total mass the same. OPLS (boolean=False) â If True, forces OPLS combining rules implicitSolvent (string=None) â If not None, creates implicit solvent force of the given name Allowed values are: HCT and âAGBNPâ (the corresponding tables must be present in the DMS file) AGBNPVersion (int=1) â AGBNP implicit solvent version close()Â¶ Close the SQL connections
