MTSIntegratorÂ¶ class openmm.mtsintegrator.MTSIntegrator(dt, groups)Â¶ MTSIntegrator implements the rRESPA multiple time step integration algorithm. This integrator allows different forces to be evaluated at different frequencies, for example to evaluate the expensive, slowly changing forces less frequently than the inexpensive, quickly changing forces. To use it, you must first divide your forces into two or more groups (by calling setForceGroup() on them) that should be evaluated at different frequencies. When you create the integrator, you provide a tuple for each group specifying the index of the force group and the frequency (as a fraction of the outermost time step) at which to evaluate it. For example: integrator = MTSIntegrator(4*femtoseconds, [(0,1), (1,2), (2,8)]) This specifies that the outermost time step is 4 fs, so each step of the integrator will advance time by that much. It also says that force group 0 should be evaluated once per time step, force group 1 should be evaluated twice per time step (every 2 fs), and force group 2 should be evaluated eight times per time step (every 0.5 fs). A common use of this algorithm is to evaluate reciprocal space nonbonded interactions less often than the bonded and direct space nonbonded interactions. The following example looks up the NonbondedForce, sets the reciprocal space interactions to their own force group, and then creates an integrator that evaluates them once every 4 fs, but all other interactions every 2 fs: nonbonded = [f for f in system.getForces() if isinstance(f, NonbondedForce)][0] nonbonded.setReciprocalSpaceForceGroup(1) integrator = MTSIntegrator(4*femtoseconds, [(1,1), (0,2)]) For details, see Tuckerman et al., J. Chem. Phys. 97(3) pp. 1990-2001 (1992). __init__(dt, groups)Â¶ Create an MTSIntegrator.

The precise meaning of this parameter is undefined, and is left up to each Platform to interpret in an appropriate way. It is guaranteed that if two simulations are run with different random number seeds, the sequence of random numbers will be different. On the other hand, no guarantees are made about the behavior of simulations that use the same seed. In particular, Platforms are permitted to use non-deterministic algorithms which produce different results on successive runs, even if those runs were initialized identically. If seed is set to 0 (which is the default value assigned), a unique seed is chosen when a Context is created from this Force. This is done to ensure that each Context receives unique random seeds without you needing to set them explicitly. setStepSize(self, size)Â¶ Set the size of each time step, in picoseconds. If this integrator uses variable time steps, the effect of calling this method is undefined, and it may simply be ignored.
