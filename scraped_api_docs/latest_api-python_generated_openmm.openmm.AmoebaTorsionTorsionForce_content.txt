AmoebaTorsionTorsionForceÂ¶ class openmm.openmm.AmoebaTorsionTorsionForce(*args)Â¶ This class implements the Amoeba torsion-torsion interaction. To use it, create an AmoebaTorsionTorsionForce object then call addTorsionTorsion() once for each torsion-torsion. After a torsion-torsion has been added, you can modify its force field parameters by calling setTorsionTorsionParameters(). __init__(self) → AmoebaTorsionTorsionForceÂ¶ __init__(self, other) → AmoebaTorsionTorsionForce Create an AmoebaTorsionTorsionForce.

If the derivatives are omitted, they are calculated automatically by fitting a 2D spline to the energies. grid[x][y][0] = x value grid[x][y][1] = y value grid[x][y][2] = energy grid[x][y][3] = dEdx value grid[x][y][4] = dEdy value grid[x][y][5] = dEd(xy) value setUsesPeriodicBoundaryConditions(self, periodic)Â¶ Set whether this force should apply periodic boundary conditions when calculating displacements. Usually this is not appropriate for bonded forces, but there are situations when it can be useful. usesPeriodicBoundaryConditions(self) → boolÂ¶ Returns whether or not this force makes use of periodic boundary conditions. Returns true if force uses PBC and false otherwise Return type bool getForceGroup(self) → intÂ¶ Get the force group this Force belongs to. getName(self) → std::string const &Â¶ Get the name of this Force. This is an arbitrary, user modifiable identifier. By default it equals the class name, but you can change it to anything useful. setForceGroup(self, group)Â¶ Set the force group this Force belongs to. Parameters group (int) â the group index. Legal values are between 0 and 31 (inclusive). setName(self, name)Â¶ Set the name of this Force. This is an arbitrary, user modifiable identifier. By default it equals the class name, but you can change it to anything useful.
