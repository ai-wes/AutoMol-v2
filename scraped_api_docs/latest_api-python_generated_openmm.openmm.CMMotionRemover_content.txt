CMMotionRemoverÂ¶ class openmm.openmm.CMMotionRemover(*args)Â¶ This class prevents the center of mass of a System from drifting. At each time step, it calculates the center of mass momentum, then adjusts the individual particle velocities to make it zero. __init__(self, frequency=1) → CMMotionRemoverÂ¶ __init__(self, other) → CMMotionRemover Create a CMMotionRemover. Methods __init__(->Â CMMotionRemover) Create a CMMotionRemover. getForceGroup(self) Get the force group this Force belongs to. getFrequency(self) Get the frequency (in time steps) at which center of mass motion should be removed getName(self) Get the name of this Force. setForceGroup(self,Â group) Set the force group this Force belongs to. setFrequency(self,Â freq) Set the frequency (in time steps) at which center of mass motion should be removed setName(self,Â name) Set the name of this Force. usesPeriodicBoundaryConditions(self) Returns whether or not this force makes use of periodic boundary conditions. Attributes thisown The membership flag property thisownÂ¶ The membership flag getFrequency(self) → intÂ¶ Get the frequency (in time steps) at which center of mass motion should be removed setFrequency(self, freq)Â¶ Set the frequency (in time steps) at which center of mass motion should be removed usesPeriodicBoundaryConditions(self) → boolÂ¶ Returns whether or not this force makes use of periodic boundary conditions. Returns true if force uses PBC and false otherwise Return type bool getForceGroup(self) → intÂ¶ Get the force group this Force belongs to. getName(self) → std::string const &Â¶ Get the name of this Force. This is an arbitrary, user modifiable identifier. By default it equals the class name, but you can change it to anything useful. setForceGroup(self, group)Â¶ Set the force group this Force belongs to. Parameters group (int) â the group index. Legal values are between 0 and 31 (inclusive). setName(self, name)Â¶ Set the name of this Force. This is an arbitrary, user modifiable identifier. By default it equals the class name, but you can change it to anything useful.
