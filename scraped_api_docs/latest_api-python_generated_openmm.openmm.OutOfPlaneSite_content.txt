OutOfPlaneSiteÂ¶ class openmm.openmm.OutOfPlaneSite(*args)Â¶ This is a VirtualSite that computes the particle location based on three other particlesâ locations. If r<sub>1</sub> is the location of particle 1, r<sub>12</sub> is the vector from particle 1 to particle 2, and r<sub>13</sub> is the vector from particle 1 to particle 3, then the virtual site location is given by r<sub>1</sub> + w<sub>12</sub>r<sub>12</sub> + w<sub>13</sub>r<sub>13</sub> + w<sub>cross</sub>(r<sub>12</sub> x r<sub>13</sub>) The three weight factors are user-specified. This allows the virtual site location to be out of the plane of the three particles. Note that while w<sub>12</sub> and w<sub>13</sub> are unitless, w<sub>cross</sub> has units of inverse distance. __init__(self, particle1, particle2, particle3, weight12, weight13, weightCross) → OutOfPlaneSiteÂ¶ __init__(self, other) → OutOfPlaneSite Create a new OutOfPlaneSite virtual site. Parameters particle1 (int) â the index of the first particle particle2 (int) â the index of the second particle particle3 (int) â the index of the third particle weight12 (double) â the weight factor for the vector from particle1 to particle2 weight13 (double) â the weight factor for the vector from particle1 to particle3 weightCross (double) â the weight factor for the cross product Methods __init__(->Â OutOfPlaneSite) Create a new OutOfPlaneSite virtual site. getNumParticles(self) Get the number of particles this virtual site depends on. getParticle(self,Â particle) Get the index of a particle this virtual site depends on. getWeight12(self) Get the weight factor for the vector from particle1 to particle2. getWeight13(self) Get the weight factor for the vector from particle1 to particle3. getWeightCross(self) Get the weight factor for the cross product.
