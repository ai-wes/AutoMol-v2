RBTorsionForceÂ¶ class openmm.openmm.RBTorsionForce(*args)Â¶ This class implements an interaction between groups of four particles that varies with the torsion angle between them according to the Ryckaert-Bellemans potential. To use it, create an RBTorsionForce object then call addTorsion() once for each torsion. After a torsion has been added, you can modify its force field parameters by calling setTorsionParameters(). This will have no effect on Contexts that already exist unless you call updateParametersInContext(). __init__(self) → RBTorsionForceÂ¶ __init__(self, other) → RBTorsionForce Create a RBTorsionForce.

Parameters index (int) â the index of the torsion for which to set parameters particle1 (int) â the index of the first particle forming the torsion particle2 (int) â the index of the second particle forming the torsion particle3 (int) â the index of the third particle forming the torsion particle4 (int) â the index of the fourth particle forming the torsion c0 (double) â the coefficient of the constant term, measured in kJ/mol c1 (double) â the coefficient of the 1st order term, measured in kJ/mol c2 (double) â the coefficient of the 2nd order term, measured in kJ/mol c3 (double) â the coefficient of the 3rd order term, measured in kJ/mol c4 (double) â the coefficient of the 4th order term, measured in kJ/mol c5 (double) â the coefficient of the 5th order term, measured in kJ/mol updateParametersInContext(self, context)Â¶ Update the per-torsion parameters in a Context to match those stored in this Force object. This method provides an efficient method to update certain parameters in an existing Context without needing to reinitialize it. Simply call setTorsionParameters() to modify this objectâs parameters, then call updateParametersInContext() to copy them over to the Context. The only information this method updates is the values of per-torsion parameters. The set of particles involved in a torsion cannot be changed, nor can new torsions be added. setUsesPeriodicBoundaryConditions(self, periodic)Â¶ Set whether this force should apply periodic boundary conditions when calculating displacements. Usually this is not appropriate for bonded forces, but there are situations when it can be useful. usesPeriodicBoundaryConditions(self) → boolÂ¶ Returns whether or not this force makes use of periodic boundary conditions. Returns true if force uses PBC and false otherwise Return type bool getForceGroup(self) → intÂ¶ Get the force group this Force belongs to. getName(self) → std::string const &Â¶ Get the name of this Force. This is an arbitrary, user modifiable identifier. By default it equals the class name, but you can change it to anything useful. setForceGroup(self, group)Â¶ Set the force group this Force belongs to. Parameters group (int) â the group index. Legal values are between 0 and 31 (inclusive). setName(self, name)Â¶ Set the name of this Force. This is an arbitrary, user modifiable identifier. By default it equals the class name, but you can change it to anything useful.
