XmlSerializerÂ¶ class openmm.openmm.XmlSerializer(*args, **kwargs)Â¶ XmlSerializer is used for serializing objects as XML, and for reconstructing them again. __init__(*args, **kwargs)Â¶ Initialize self. See help(type(self)) for accurate signature. Methods __init__(*args,Â **kwargs) Initialize self. clone(object) Clone an object by first serializing it, then deserializing it again. deserialize(inputString) Reconstruct an object that has been serialized as XML. deserializeSystem(inputString) This method exists only for backward compatibility. serialize(object) Serialize an object as XML. serializeSystem(object) This method exists only for backward compatibility. Attributes thisown The membership flag property thisownÂ¶ The membership flag static serializeSystem(object) → std::stringÂ¶ This method exists only for backward compatibility. Deprecated Use serialize() instead. static deserializeSystem(inputString) → SystemÂ¶ This method exists only for backward compatibility. Deprecated Use deserialize() instead. static serialize(object)Â¶ Serialize an object as XML. static deserialize(inputString)Â¶ Reconstruct an object that has been serialized as XML. static clone(object)Â¶ Clone an object by first serializing it, then deserializing it again. This method constructs the new object directly from the SerializationNodes without first converting them to XML. This means it is faster and uses less memory than making separate calls to serialize() and deserialize().
