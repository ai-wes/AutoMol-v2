It is unlikely the user will need to create new ones. __init__(name)Â¶ Create a new BaseDimension. Each new BaseDimension is assumed to be independent of all other BaseDimensions. Use the existing BaseDimensions instead of creating new ones. Methods __init__(name) Create a new BaseDimension. __lt__(other)Â¶ The implicit order of BaseDimensions is the order in which they were created. This method is used for using BaseDimensions as hash keys, and also affects the order in which units appear in multi-dimensional Quantities.
