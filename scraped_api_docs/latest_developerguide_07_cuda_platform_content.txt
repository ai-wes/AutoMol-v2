7. The CUDA PlatformÂ¶ The CUDA platform is very similar to the OpenCL platform, and most of the previous chapter applies equally well to it, just changing âOpenCLâ to âCudaâ in class names. There are a few differences worth noting. 7.1. Caching KernelsÂ¶ Like the OpenCL platform, the CUDA platform compiles all its kernels at runtime. To improve performance, it tries to cache the compiled kernels on disk for later use. This allows subsequent Contexts to skip compiling some kernels. To make this work, it needs a directory on disk where it can write out temporary files. It is specified by the âCudaTempDirectoryâ property when you create a new Context. It usually can figure out a suitable value on its own, but sometimes it needs help. See the âPlatform-Specific Propertiesâ chapter of the Userâs Manual for details. 7.2. Accumulating ForcesÂ¶ The OpenCL platform, as described in Section 6.3, uses two types of buffers for accumulating forces: a set of floating point buffers, and a single fixed point buffer. In contrast, the CUDA platform uses only the fixed point buffer (represented by the CUDA type long long).
